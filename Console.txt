// ! VIEW YOUR CURRENT AVATAR THUMBNAIL CUSTOMIZATIONS: https://avatar.roblox.com/v1/avatar/thumbnail-customizations

// ! This script is using the API of an intentional feature, it's not a bug. Roblox may disable the ability for the thumbnail generator to use thumbnail customizations **at any time**.
// ! The API was enabled two times before the Profile Picture Editor in the app was enabled;
// ! You probably would only get terminated if you get caught using the feature inappropriately.

/*
!! After your first time of setting a thumbnail configuration, the thumbnail of that type cannot go back to how it was originally.
!! (i.e.: using Idle Animations, camera position). It can only be temporarily reverted if Roblox disables this feature again.
